# AldoBot.js
Discord.js bot

## Inspiration
Heavily inspired by AnIdiotsGuide's tutorial source code [here](https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/Tutorial-Bot)

Highly recommend checking out his tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVfjZrqoQ7o&list=PLR2_rarYLHfg6ZJqq0WTMmI9uLcd7_GRO)

## Setup
Clone this repo

Edit settings.1.JSON filling in required information (all marked in file)

This will involve creating a new bot token which can be done on the discord dev website. Instructions to do so can be found [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)

*IMPORTANT* rename the file from settings.1.JSON to just settings.JSON before starting the bot 

## Starting the Bot
Just to be safe, navigate to the project folder and open a command prompt there. type npm install

Start a command line at the root of the projects folder (If you haven't already done so), and type npm start
