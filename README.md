# AldoBot.js
Discord.js bot

# Inspiration
Heavily inspired by AnIdiotsGuide's tutorial source code here: https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/Tutorial-Bot
Highly recommend checking out his tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVfjZrqoQ7o&list=PLR2_rarYLHfg6ZJqq0WTMmI9uLcd7_GRO

# Setup
Clone this repo

Edit settings.1.JSON filling in required information (all marked in file)
This will involve creating a new bot token which can be done on the discord dev websit

*IMPORTANT* rename the file from settings.1.JSON to just settings.JSON before starting the bot 

# Starting the Bot
Start a command line at the root of the projects folder, and type npm start
